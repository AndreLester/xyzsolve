##xyzsolve

*Clone of the project from Google Code*

This projects implements a simple python-based equation solver for small non-linear problems (<50-100 equations). The code also includes a simple lexer-parser system that can accept a simple description of the equations as naturally formulated.

The equation solver is python translation of a Fortran-based modified Powell algorithm for non-linear root finding. A slight modifications allows for hard min-max bounds on all the variables.

All code is available for any use (including commercial) under a BSD style license.
